        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Mom's spaghetti Bolognese recipe was passed on from my Italian grandfather. The ultimate comfort food. Leftovers freeze nicely! To make this recipe more authentic, you can use a mixture of ground veal, pork, and beef. You can also substitute 1/2 cup of red wine for the balsamic vinegar.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 spaghetti package</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>3 strips of bacon - diced</li>
            <li>1 large onion - finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery - finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 carrot - finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>2 tbsp balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>2 cans of crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tsp white sugar</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in spaghetti and return to a boil. Cook spaghetti uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; add bacon. Cook, turning occasionally, until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Add onion, celery, carrot, and oregano to bacon; continue cooking until vegetables begin to soften, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Crumble in ground beef; cook and stir until no longer pink and completely cooked, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour vinegar over ground beef mixture; simmer until liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and sugar; bring to a boil, season with salt and black pepper, then remove from heat. Stir in basil .</li>
            <li>Spoon sauce over spaghetti; top with Parmesan cheese to serve.</li>
        </ol>
