Learning Code - Odin Project No.1

This is the first project along my journey to learning how to code, I will be following the odin project tutorial with some HTML basics.

In the end I will display the use of different tags to display information on a page, the use of lists, anchor tags and images, embedding links on the page and correct use of heading and paragraphs.
